This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the front-end component of the Flix-vue app. To get started, make sure that you have all of the needed node modules
### `npm install` or `yarn install`

Once that is done, you can start the front-end:
### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Running that should open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.
