Welcome to the Flix-vue app, a really simple NodeJs/ReactJs that allows you to see and search the most popular movies.
Data and apis are provided via The Movie Database API

## Let's get started

First, let's get the backend started with node, run this to make sure you have all of the node modules needed:
### `npm install` 

Then, let's do the same for the frontend client
### `cd client && npm install`

Once that is done, fire up the backend and front-end
### For backend, `node server.js` from the root

Or you can use nodemon to start, nodemon will auto restart when changes are made

### For frontend, `npm start`

## Note
The backend will open up on http://localhost:5000/
while, the frontend runs from http://localhost:3000/
